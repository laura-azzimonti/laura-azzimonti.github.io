#Main interests
My main research interests are Bayesian networks, hierarchical Bayesian modelling, federated learning, and the application of machine learning techniques to personalised medicine. 

Some of the applied projects in the biomedical field are described at the [IDSIA health website](https://health.idsia.ch).
